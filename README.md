Using deep learning to model brain function

This repo contains an experiment where an artificial neural network has to move an object (green dot) towards a target (red dot). The input to the network at each timestep t is an rgb image representing the state (positions) of the object and the target. The output is the position of the object at the next timestep t+1 (which is used to generate the input rgb image at t+1).
